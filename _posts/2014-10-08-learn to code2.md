title: Learn to Code - Gain Momentum by Setting a Goal
---

Once you have taken the <a href="./learn-to-code1">first steps</a> in learning to code, be intentional about gaining and maintaining your coding momentum. After a great start, interest often fizzles and progress comes to a halt. Think New Year’s resolutions circa February, any given year. Let’s look at how to prevent this and steps to take to keep up the pace.

## Set a Goal

Having a clearly defined goal can anchor your efforts and give you a target towards which you can reach. Write out the following questions on a piece of paper, note taking app or other place you record your thoughts:

1.  What am I going to accomplish?

2.  When is my deadline?

3.  How will I measure success?

4.  How will I achieve this goal?

Answering these four questions will give you the minimum amount of information needed to know what your goal is and measure progress along the way. My first goal in learning to code was a 100 Day Coding Streak. Here’s how I answered the four goal questions.

1.  What am I going to accomplish?  Code 100 days in a row

2.  When is my deadline?  100 days from day one

3.  How will I measure success?  Track days coded on a calendar

4.  How will I achieve this goal?  Perform HTML and CSS coding exercises daily

When I reached day 100 and completed my goal, I was ecstatic and felt a sense of accomplishment. What seemed like a difficult task turned into my first measurable achievement in coding. Reaching this goal also helped cement coding as my new hobby and a part of my daily life.

## Go Beyond the Basics

Here are a few tips to take goal setting even further and go beyond the basics.

Pick a goal that is achievable, but only with effort and diligence. A goal that is too easy may not push you to become better. A goal that is too far out of reach can cause you to become discouraged and inclined to give up.
Tell people. Inform family and friends so they can support and encourage you along the way.
Decide on a reward to celebrate your achievement. Make it an item or experience that will help keep you motivated.
The questions and tips shared above helped me to achieve my first coding goal. I continue to employ them today for both coding and life goals in general. Take some time today to decide what you want to accomplish. Then, write or type it to keep the goal in the forefront of your mind. I’m confident this approach can help you achieve your goals as well. Good luck!
