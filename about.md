Hi, I'm Danielle! I am an engineer and web developer focusing on full stack development. I enjoy the process of learning and the challenge of keeping up with new technologies in web development and software engineering. I have a mechanical engineering degree and background with experience in project and process management in manufacturing, procurement, and supply chain. I am currently learning Ruby and I have experience with Python and Node.js as well. You can find me on line at the links below. 

Thanks for stopping by!
